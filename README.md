# Bank of Flatiron
Welcome to the Bank of Flatiron, where you can trust us with all your financial data!

## Instructions
For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.

Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for setting up the application.


## Setup 

Use <a href = https://phase-2-week-1-codechallenge-lemon.vercel.app>this link</a> to get the deployed site
<li>You can also fork and clone this repository <strong>https://github.com/Ngecha/phase-2-week-1-codechallenge</strong> in to your computer </li>
 <li>Open the project-folder using VS code.
<li>Then run npm start in your terminal to open the react app in your browser</li>
<li><b>Ensure the db.json server is running</b></li>

## Core Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:
<li>
See a table of the transactions.<br></li>
<li>Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table as well as post the new transaction to the backend API for persistence. <br></li>
<li>Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.<br></li>
